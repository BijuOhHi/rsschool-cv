## About Myself

In my two years of college, as a tech programmer, I realized that I actually have skills and potential in this field. At the moment, I can combine work and education because I work as a system administrator in a library. My employer and colleagues note that I am ready to go with full confidence to the goal and achieve success. I believe I can become a Frontend developer in the future.
